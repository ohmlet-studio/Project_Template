00:00:03,822 --> 00:00:06,648
Wow, it's the Ultimate Fighting Warrior box!

2
00:00:07,057 --> 00:00:09,680
I coded the whole game by myself during a game jam.

3
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:10,746
Yeah...

4
00:00:11,182 --> 00:00:12,924
I couldn't find anyone that wanted to work with me.

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:14,764
But I had SOOOOOO much fun,

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,008
I created a whole universe

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,742
and I even customized a game box.

8
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,871
Unfortunately, I don't think anyone ever played it in the end

9
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,000
except for my crush at the time.
