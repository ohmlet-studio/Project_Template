1
00:00:00,942 --> 00:00:03,280
I'd joined a queer board game club at that age.

2
00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:05,400
It was Elio who'd brought me there.

3
00:00:06,097 --> 00:00:08,853
At first I was scared, but it actually did me SO much good.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,208
That's how I discovered my community.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,804
It was a real bubble of kindness and mutual support.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,035
Well...

7
00:00:16,115 --> 00:00:18,660
until two people started accusing each other of assault 

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,257
and everyone had to choose sides.

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,506
I couldn't, it was too hard.

10
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,293
I just... left.
