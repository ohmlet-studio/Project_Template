1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,746
Oh...

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,633
This was when I was a teenager?

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,006
*Laughter*

4
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,880
I was a MASSIVE emo back then.

5
00:00:08,446 --> 00:00:10,260
I spent my sophomore year listening to that group.

6
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:12,753
What was that song I listened to all the time?

7
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,080
Oh well, never mind,

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,500
looking back, it really wasn't THAT great.

9
00:00:17,653 --> 00:00:20,226
In any case, I didn't have any math posters.

10
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,870
At the time of my life, I mainly wanted to meet new people

11
00:00:22,866 --> 00:00:24,650
and share the ideas that came out of my head.
