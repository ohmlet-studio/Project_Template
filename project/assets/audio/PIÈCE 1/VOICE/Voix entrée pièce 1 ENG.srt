1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,793
Um...

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,326
But... is that my room from when I was in college?!

3
00:00:06,266 --> 00:00:07,213
Hmm...

4
00:00:08,193 --> 00:00:09,733
I didn't stay in college for long.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,430
Nearly everyone pissed me off.

6
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:14,533
I chose math to please my parents,

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,386
but I didn't understand anything

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,100
and I clearly had other things on my mind.

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,113
At least I made a few friends who were like me.

10
00:00:20,713 --> 00:00:22,173
We didn't really go to classes.

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,820
We spent most of our time at Koda's place

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,546
who had his own apartment near the university.
