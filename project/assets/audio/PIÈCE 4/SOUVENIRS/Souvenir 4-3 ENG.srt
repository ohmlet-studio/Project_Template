00:00:01,262 --> 00:00:03,840
Every week, I went to an 'introduction to music' class.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,253
It's been a while, but...

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,280
I remember that at first, I had NOOOO social skills.

4
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,040
NOTHING made sense to me.

5
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:11,368
So it helped me a lot to be in a group

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,791
with activities to do.

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,860
I could learn the 'codes' 

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,555
by observing others without too much pressure.

9
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,684
However, there was one ' social code' I never understood.

10
00:00:17,777 --> 00:00:19,355
It's why some people were

11
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,702
humiliated, beaten, or excluded by others.
