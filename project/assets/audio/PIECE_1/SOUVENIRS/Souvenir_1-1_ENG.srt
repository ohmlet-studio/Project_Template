Oh, my blue sketchbook!

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,380
I spent ALOT of time doodling in this!

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,660
I didn't know what to do with all my ideas...

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,300
So sketching everything really helped me clear my head.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,660
Hmm, I wonder where my other sketchbooks are.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,080
I really LOVED drawing,

00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,100
but I always hated the result.
