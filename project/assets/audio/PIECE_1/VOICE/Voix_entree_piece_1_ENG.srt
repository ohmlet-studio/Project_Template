00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,793
Wait... Isn't this...?

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,326
my room from when I was in college?!

3
00:00:06,266 --> 00:00:07,213
Hmmmmm...

4
00:00:08,193 --> 00:00:09,733
I remember I didn't stay in college for long.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,430
Nearly everyone pissed me off.

6
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:14,533
I chose math to please my parents,

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,386
but didn't understand a thing

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,100
and I clearly had other things on my mind.

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,113
At least I made a few friends

10
00:00:20,713 --> 00:00:22,173
But we didn't really go to our classes.

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,820
We spent most of our time at Koda's place

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26
They had their own apartment near the university.
